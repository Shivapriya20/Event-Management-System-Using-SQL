# Event-Management-System

The objective of the Event Management System project is to develop a thorough and effective platform for managing every aspect of planning and carrying out events. This system will speed up the whole event planning process and offer tools for smooth execution, whether it's a corporate conference, wedding, music concert, or community gathering.
